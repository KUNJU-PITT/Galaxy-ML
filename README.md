# Galaxy-ML
This repo provides a set of [Galaxy](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy) tools wrapped with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Galaxy machine learning tries to offer:
*  _simple web UI_
*  _no coding or minimum coding requirement_
*  _fast model deployment and model selection_
*  _high level of parallel and automated computation_


By far, Galaxy-ML _**supports**_:
* _[scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)_
* _[xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)_
* _[imblanced-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn)_
* _[skrebate](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/scikit-rebate/tree/master/skrebate)_
* _special implementations for drug response prediction using RNA-seq, like [IRAPS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5445594/)_

Up-coming supports are:
* _deep learning_
* _stacking ensemble_
